An experienced software developer proficient in web backend development and have basic knowledge about DevOps and data analysis. The two years of remote work experience proves that I'm self-disciplined and capable of co-operating with others. I'm also a passionate and self-motivated learner that frequently participate in tech conferences and contribute to open source projects.
Beside programming skills, I also have experience in management and coordinate people. I held a 2-month educational program and led 16 team members.
