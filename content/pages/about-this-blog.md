Hi, this is Lee Wei

**Welcome to my blog.**

Currently, there are 3 kinds of articles in this blog.

### 1. Articles
Originally, this blog should be a tech blog or something like that.
But now, I also share what I like and think.

### 2. Book Digestion
I love reading but I forget what I read quickly.
So I take notes for them.

### 3. Paper Summary
Since I'm now a graduate student, I have to read papers and do summarization.
I think it would be a pity if I only them only with my labmates.
Thus, I share them with all you guys.
