**Welcome to Wei Lee's blog.**

I use this blog as my personal note.
The articles are organized into the following three categories.

#### 1. Tech

All the articles related to programming would be places here.

#### 2. Book

I love reading, as well.
It would be a shame if I finish reading the book and forget everything.
Although I might not have time to add too much personal thought on these digests, I think it would still be a useful guide for someone interested in the book.

#### 3. Gossiping

Sometimes I want to share my thought, and those posts would be placed here.
